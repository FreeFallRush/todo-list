# todo-list

Project: ToDo List - from The Odin Project Curriculum -> Path (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

---> [view project](https://freefallrush.github.io/todo-list/) <----

The project asks to dynamically create a Todo List, either with factories or classes. The TodoList should include projects for the todos lists. Each project and todo should be edited and deleted.
The todos should have a due date implemented with date-fns.
The Todo List should have local storage.

The project helped me to better structure my webpack files, to add local storage to use the date-fns library and to better understand how to generate objects with classes. The main struggles where with filtering the todos on each page and managing to make them editable, but also making the local storage functional for the todo list.
The high complexity of the exercise helped me solidify more the js classes lesson, working with webpack and deploying webpack projects on github.
